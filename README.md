# Xmeme app

1. Users can post Memes by providing these inputs
   - Name of the person posting the meme

# Reflection

This was a 1 week long project built during my second module at Crio WOD program. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with deployment and documentation. This project truly gave me a good experience and understanding of the lifecycle of a fullstack application i.e. from frontend, backend and databases to deployment.
